<p>Please note that Verizon is not responsible for information, content, app or services provided by others. Before you access, use, link to or download a service or app on your computer, television, wireless or other device, you should review the associated terms of service and privacy policy.

Examples of this information include gender, age range, education, sports enthusiast, frequent diner or pet owner.

<p>When you use social media credentials to login to or otherwise interact with a Verizon site or offer, we may collect information about your social media profile, such as your interests, &#x201C;likes&#x201D; and friends list. We may use this information, for example, to personalize your Verizon experiences and marketing communications, to enhance our services and to better serve you. You can control this data sharing via options in your social media accounts.</p>
<p>We also obtain contact information and other marketing lead information from third parties, website &#x201C;refer-a-friend&#x201D; options or social media platforms and may combine it with information we have to contact you or direct Verizon&apos;s marketing offers to you.</p>

We use this information for operational, performance measurement and other business purposes; and to help us deliver more relevant Verizon marketing messages on our websites, on non-Verizon websites, by our representatives, via email, or via other Verizon services or devices. This information is also used to tailor the content you see, manage the frequency with which you see an advertisement, tailor advertisements to better match your interests and understand the effectiveness of our advertising. We also may use this information to assess the effectiveness of our sites and to help you should you request help with navigation problems on these sites. Additional information about the information collected on AOL websites is described in the <a href="http://privacy.aol.com/" target="_blank">AOL privacy policy</a>.</p>
<p>Certain Verizon vendors may place and read <a href="/about/privacy/cookies">cookies</a> on our sites to help us deliver Verizon marketing messages on our sites and on non-Verizon sites. We require that these vendors provide consumers with the ability to opt out of their use of information for these purposes. In accordance with <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/" target="_blank">industry self-regulatory principles</a>, you should see this icon in <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/" target="_blank"><img style="width: 25px !important; height: 25px;" class="media-element file-default" src="http://www.verizon.com/about/sites/default/files/icon-Verizon-advertisements.jpg" alt=""></a> or around Verizon advertisements that are delivered on other sites using information collected on our sites.

<h5 style="padding-top:6px;">Information you provide</h5>
<p>When you contact us for information about products and services or when you enter a Verizon-sponsored or affiliated contest, sweepstakes or promotion, we may use the information you supply to provide you with information about Verizon services, programs and offerings. Certain promotions may require that we disclose information such as contest winners or provide information for prize fulfillment, and as required by law or permitted by the promotion&#x2019;s official rules. Information you provide on our websites about your preferred location and other preferences may be used to provide you with more relevant product recommendations, services and special offers.</p>
<p>If you provide information to us in the context of an event or promotion that Verizon sponsors with another organization, or if you visit a co-sponsored site or use a co-sponsored service, you also may be providing information to the co-sponsor. You should refer to that co-sponsor&apos;s privacy policy for information about its practices which may differ from Verizon&apos;s practices.</p>
<p>We also collect information from you when you participate in surveys or provide other feedback to us regarding our products or services, when you register to receive news or public policy updates, or when you apply for a job with or a grant from Verizon. We use this information only for the purpose for which you provide it.</p>

When you open a Verizon email or click on links within these emails, we may collect and retain information to provide you with future communications that may be more interesting to you. Please note that Verizon will not ask you to send us, via email, sensitive personal or account information.</p>
<h5 style="padding-top:6px;">Additional information for Verizon Wireless customers</h5>
<p>Verizon Wireless includes a <a href="http://www.verizonwireless.com/support/unique-identifier-header-faqs/" target="_blank">unique identifier</a> in certain web traffic from your mobile device. The identifier is used to help deliver relevant advertising and to deliver other services such as authenticating devices on the network. If you opt out of the <a href="http://www.verizonwireless.com/support/mobile-ads-faqs/" target="_blank">Relevant Mobile Advertising</a> program and you have not joined Verizon <a href="http://www.verizonwireless.com/support/verizon-selects-faqs/" target="_blank">Selects</a>, or if you activate certain types of lines that are not eligible to participate in our advertising programs, Verizon Wireless will stop inserting the <a href="http://www.verizonwireless.com/support/unique-identifier-header-faqs/" target="_blank">Unique Identifier Header (UIDH)</a>. The identifier will continue to appear for a short period of time while we are updating our systems.</p>
<p>Verizon Wireless collects and uses mobile device location data for a variety of purposes, including to provide our mobile voice and data services, emergency services, and our and third-party location-based apps and services such as navigation, weather, mapping and child safety apps or tools. Verizon apps that use location information provide choices about the use of this information.</p>
<p>Many types of wireless apps and services use mobile device location data, including apps provided by other companies and wireless device operating systems. When you are considering new apps or services, you should carefully review the location-based services&apos; or app providers&apos; privacy policies to learn how they collect and use your information.</p>
<p>Verizon-supplied system application software may be present on your wireless device to enable automatic installation of apps when you activate your device and with your consent at later times. For example, at your request, this software may be used to install or open an app or your browser to a specific page based on an interaction you are having with a company&#x2019;s telephone voice response system. The software collects certain usage information about the actions it takes, including first open and uninstalls. You can delete or disable apps installed by this software at any time.</p>
<p>Verizon Wireless does not publish directories of our customers&apos; wireless phone numbers, and we do not provide or make them available to third parties for listing in directories unless you request that we do so.</p>
<h5 style="padding-top:6px;">Information about the Cable Act</h5>
<p>To the extent that Section 631 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (the &quot;Cable Act&quot;) applies to services you purchase, it entitles you to know about the personally identifiable information a cable service provider collects. This includes the nature of the use and disclosure of this information and to whom it may be disclosed, how long personally identifiable information is maintained, and how subscribers may access it. In addition, the Cable Act imposes limits on the collection and disclosure of personal information and gives subscribers the ability to enforce their privacy rights. (Personally identifiable information does not include aggregate data that does not identify a particular person).</p>
<p>The Cable Act allows a provider to use its cable system to collect personally identifiable information necessary to render a cable service or other services provided to subscribers and to detect and prevent unauthorized access to services. Additional personally identifiable information may be collected with the subscriber&#x2019;s prior consent. Personally identifiable information may be used or disclosed without the subscriber&#x2019;s consent where necessary to render services, and to conduct legitimate business activities related to services provided.</p>
<p>We may be required by law to disclose personally identifiable information to a governmental entity to comply with valid legal process, such as warrants, court orders or subpoenas, but we will not disclose records revealing your selection of video programming unless we receive a court order indicating that the governmental entity has made a specified showing of relevance and you were afforded an opportunity to contest the order. We may be required to disclose personally identifiable information (including your selection of video programming) to a non-governmental entity to comply with a court order, after you have been provided notice.</p>
<p>If you believe that your privacy rights have been violated, please <a href="mailto:privacyoffice@verizon.com">e-mail us </a>and we will work with you to address your concerns. If you believe that you have been aggrieved as a result of a violation of the Cable Act, you may enforce the limitations imposed by the Cable Act through a civil action in a United States district court seeking damages, attorney&apos;s fees, and litigation costs. Other rights and remedies may also be available to you under federal or other applicable laws.</p>
<p>The Cable Act permits the disclosure of customer names and addresses as long as a subscriber has been provided with the opportunity to prohibit or limit this disclosure and the disclosure does not reveal, directly or indirectly, the subscriber&#x2019;s viewing or other uses of the cable or other services provided. If we intend to share data in this way, we will provide you with the opportunity to prohibit or limit this type of sharing.</p>
<h5 style="padding-top:6px;">Additional Information for hum service</h5>
<p>hum service includes vehicle diagnostics, vehicle location assistance, one-button emergency calling, automated alerts to emergency personnel when a potential accident is detected, and roadside assistance services as well as possible discounts on travel, automotive, car rental and other offers. When installed in your car, the hum system collects information about your vehicle&apos;s performance and maintenance characteristics, as well as vehicle location and use information (including trip distances, acceleration, deceleration, turning, speed and revolutions per minute). In addition to other uses described in this policy, this information will be used to develop and provide a driving tips feature planned for introduction in 2016. This feature is expected to rate your overall driving and suggest ways in which driving could potentially be improved.</p>
<p>Information that identifies your vehicle and other personal information may be shared as described in the information sharing sections of this policy as well as when it is necessary to provide various hum service features, such as alerting emergency personnel of your location if a crash is detected, helping authorities locate your vehicle if you report it stolen or helping roadside assistance locate your vehicle.</p>
<p>hum information may also be used on its own or in combination with other Verizon information to determine aggregate insights about hum users.&#xA0; For example, a company may find it valuable to know the number of vehicles on different roads at various times during the day and the percent of drivers of those vehicles that are in a certain age range.&#xA0; hum information may also be shared with third parties in a way that does not identify you personally.&#xA0; For example, it may be usedto provide traffic reporting and similar services or to inform car manufacturers about characteristics of different vehicle models.</p>

<h3><a name="information_shared" id="information_shared"></a>Information we share</h3>
<h5 style="padding-top:6px;">Information shared within the Verizon family of companies:</h5>
<p>Verizon shares customer information within our family of companies for a variety of purposes, including, for example, providing you with the latest information about our products and services and offering you our latest promotions. You can limit the sharing of certain types of customer information, known as Customer Proprietary Network Information, or CPNI, within the Verizon family of companies for marketing services to you other than your current services.</p>
<p>Customer Proprietary Network Information (CPNI) is information that relates to the type, quantity, destination, technical configuration, location, amount of use and related billing information of your telecommunications or interconnected Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) services. Federal law governs our use and sharing of CPNI.</p>
<h5 style="padding-top:6px;">Information shared outside the Verizon family of companies:</h5>
<p>Except as explained in this Privacy Policy, in privacy policies for specific services, or in agreements with our customers, Verizon does not sell, license or share information that individually identifies our customers, people using our networks, or website visitors with others outside the Verizon family of companies that are not performing work on Verizon&apos;s behalf without the consent of the person whose information will be shared.</p>
<p>Verizon uses vendors and partners for a variety of business purposes such as to help us offer, provide, repair, restore and bill for services we provide. We share information with those vendors and partners when it is necessary for them to perform work on our behalf. For example, we may provide your credit card information and billing address to our payment processing company solely for the purpose of processing payment for a transaction you have requested. We require that these vendors and partners protect the customer information we provide to them and limit their use of Verizon customer data to the purposes for which it was provided. We do not permit these types of vendors and partners to use this information for their own marketing purposes.</p>
<p>As described in more detail in other sections of this policy, Verizon also may share certain information with outside companies, for example, to assist with the delivery of <a href="http://www.verizon.com/about/privacy/full-privacy-policy#advertising_campaigns">advertising campaigns</a>, or preparing and sharing aggregate reports. This information does not identify Verizon customers individually.</p>
<p>Verizon provides the names, addresses and telephone numbers of wireline telephone customers to directory publishers and directory assistance services unless a non-published or non-listed phone number has been requested.</p>

<p>You may see third-party advertisements on some Verizon websites, services, apps and devices. Some advertisements are chosen by companies that operate on our sites and other sites (for example, ad servers, ad networks, or technology platforms) to place ads on behalf of advertisers. These companies may place and access cookies on your device to collect information about your visit on websites and may collect device advertising identifiers from your mobile operating system to learn about your use of apps, including ours. The information they collect from our sites and apps is in a form that does not identify you personally and may be combined with similar data they obtain from other websites and apps to help advertisers better reach audiences they wish to target. Targeting may be accomplished by tailoring advertising to interests that they infer from your interactions on our sites and apps and your interaction with other sites and services where these companies also are present.

<h3>Working together to keep children safe.</h3>
<p>Verizon recognizes that online service providers must be vigilant in protecting the safety and privacy of children online. We do not knowingly market to or solicit information from children under the age of 13 without obtaining verifiable parental consent.</p>
<p>To learn more about AOL&apos;s information practices with respect to children under 13, please review <a href="http://privacy.aol.com/notetoparents" target="_blank">AOL&apos;s Important Note to Parents</a>.</p>
<p>Regrettably, there are those who use the Internet to view, store and distribute child pornography (or who engage in other types of illegal activity involving children). Child pornography is subject to severe criminal penalties and using the Verizon network to view, store or distribute it violates our service contracts. The Verizon network may not be used by customers in any manner for the storage, transmission or dissemination of images containing child pornography and we will report any instances of such activity of which we become aware to the appropriate law enforcement authorities.</p>
<p>If you have a complaint about child pornography, the soliciting of children for sexual activity, or any other illegal or inappropriate activity involving children on a Verizon service, report it to us by <a href="mailto:abuse@verizon.net?subject=I%20am%20reporting%20an%20incident%20of%20Child%20Pornography">sending an e-mail</a>. Please include the words &quot;child porn&quot; in the subject line of your email. You can also make a report directly to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children through <a href="http://www.cybertipline.org" target="_blank">CyberTipline</a>.</p>
