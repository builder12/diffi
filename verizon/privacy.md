### Information we collect and how it is used

We collect information when you communicate with us and when you use our products, services and sites. This includes information you provide such as name and contact information, images, the reason for contacting us, driver's license number, Social Security Number and payment information. Service usage information we collect includes call records, websites visited, wireless location, application and feature usage, network traffic data, product and device-specific information and identifiers, service options you choose, mobile and device numbers, video streaming and video packages and usage, movie rental and purchase data, TV and other video viewership, and other similar information.

We use this information to establish, monitor and maintain your account and billing records; measure credit and payment risk; provide account-related services; deliver and maintain your products and services; help you with service-related issues or questions; manage and protect our networks, services and users from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful uses; help us improve our services and research and develop new products and services; authenticate you; determine your eligibility for new products and services and contact you with marketing offers.

When you contact us or we contact you, we may monitor or record that communication or keep a record of the transaction to help us train employees and better serve you.

We may automatically measure and monitor network performance and the performance of your connections to improve your, or our, service levels and products. If you contact us for service support, we also may access information about your computer, wireless device or other device settings to provide customized technical support or to install specific applications or services that you use or that are necessary to the applications or services you use.

Information about your use of Verizon products and services may be aggregated or anonymized for business and marketing uses by us or by third parties. For example, aggregate or anonymous data may be used to improve our services, measure and analyze the use of services and to help make services and advertising more relevant to you.

When you establish an online account or register on our sites or apps, we may collect information about your user identification, password and secret questions and answers. We use this information to authenticate you when you sign in.

Verizon will obtain your affirmative consent before we use information we gathered in the course of providing broadband Internet access services about your visits over time to different non-Verizon websites to customize ads specifically to you. One such program is [Verizon Selects][154].

Please note that Verizon is not responsible for information, content, app or services provided by others. Before you access, use, link to or download a service or app on your computer, television, wireless or other device, you should review the associated terms of service and privacy policy. Personal information you submit in those contexts may be read, collected or used by the service or app provider and others in ways that are different from described here.

##### Information provided to us by third parties

When you purchase products or apply for service with us, we may obtain credit information about you from outside credit reporting agencies to help us with customer authentication and credit-related decisions. If you lease your residence, we may have information about how to reach your landlord and whether landlord permission is required to install our facilities.

Verizon obtains information from outside companies such as those that collect consumer information including demographic and interest data. Examples of this information include gender, age range, sports enthusiast, frequent diner or pet owner. We use this data and combine it with other information we have about you to help us predict your preferences and to direct marketing offers that might be more relevant to you.

When you use social media credentials to login to or otherwise interact with a Verizon site or offer, we may collect information about your social media profile, such as your interests, "likes" and friends list. We may use this information, for example, to personalize your Verizon experiences and marketing communications, to enhance our services and to better serve you. You can control this data sharing via options in your social media accounts.

We also obtain contact information and other marketing lead information from third parties, website "refer-a-friend" options or social media platforms and may combine it with information we have to contact you or direct Verizon's marketing offers to you.

##### Information collected on Verizon websites and apps

When you use Verizon websites and apps, information is collected about your device and your visit including browsing, searching and buying activity as you interact with our sites and apps; IP address; mobile telephone or device numbers; account information; web addresses of the sites you come from and go to next; and information about your connection, including your device's browser, operating system, platform type and Internet connection speed. We use this information for operational, performance measurement and other business purposes; and to help us deliver more relevant Verizon marketing messages on our websites, on non-Verizon websites, by our representatives, via email, or via other Verizon services or devices. This information is also used to tailor the content you see, manage the frequency with which you see an advertisement, tailor advertisements to better match your interests and understand the effectiveness of our advertising. We also may use this information to assess the effectiveness of our sites and to help you should you request help with navigation problems on these sites. Additional information about the information collected on AOL websites is described in the [AOL privacy policy][152].

Certain Verizon vendors may place and read [cookies][155] on our sites to help us deliver Verizon marketing messages on our sites and on non-Verizon sites. We require that these vendors provide consumers with the ability to opt out of their use of information for these purposes. In accordance with [industry self-regulatory principles][156], you should see this icon in ![][157] or around Verizon advertisements that are delivered on other sites using information collected on our sites. Clicking on this icon will provide information about the companies and data practices that were used to deliver the ad and will also describe how you may opt out of this type of advertising program. Additional information on the choices available to you for the use of your information for advertising purposes can be found in the "How to limit the sharing and use of your information" section below. [View information about "cookies" and related technologies][155]

##### Information you provide

When you contact us for information about products and services or when you enter a Verizon-sponsored or affiliated contest, sweepstakes or promotion, we may use the information you supply to provide you with information about Verizon services, programs and offerings. Certain promotions may require that we disclose information such as contest winners or provide information for prize fulfillment, and as required by law or permitted by the promotion's official rules. Information you provide on our websites about your preferred location and other preferences may be used to provide you with more relevant product recommendations, services and special offers.

If you provide information to us in the context of an event or promotion that Verizon sponsors with another organization, or if you visit a co-sponsored site or use a co-sponsored service, you also may be providing information to the co-sponsor. You should refer to that co-sponsor's privacy policy for information about its practices which may differ from Verizon's practices.

We also collect information from you when you participate in surveys or provide other feedback to us regarding our products or services, when you register to receive news or public policy updates, or when you apply for a job with or a grant from Verizon. We use this information only for the purpose for which you provide it.

Verizon may send you emails that communicate information about your account or about products, services, marketing offers or promotions that may be of interest to you. When you open a Verizon email or click on links within these emails, we may collect and retain information to provide you with future communications that may be more interesting to you. Please note that Verizon will not ask you to send us, via email, sensitive personal or account information.

##### Additional information for Verizon Wireless customers

Verizon Wireless inserts a [unique identifier][158] in certain web traffic from your mobile device. The identifier is used to identify eligible mobile device (through both the Relevant Mobile Advertising and Selects advertising programs) and to deliver other services. If you opt out of the [Relevant Mobile Advertising][159] program and you have not joined Verizon [Selects][154], or if you activate certain types of lines that are not eligible to participate in our advertising programs, Verizon Wireless will stop inserting the [Unique Identifier Header (UIDH)][158]. The identifier will continue to appear for a short period of time while we are updating our systems.

Verizon Wireless collects and uses mobile device location data for a variety of purposes, including to provide our mobile voice and data services, emergency services, and our and third-party location-based apps and services such as navigation, weather, mapping and child safety apps or tools. Verizon apps that use location information provide choices about the use of this information.

Many types of wireless apps and services use mobile device location data, including apps provided by other companies and wireless device operating systems. When you are considering new apps or services, you should carefully review the location-based services' or app providers' privacy policies to learn how they collect and use your information.

Verizon-supplied system application software may be present on your wireless device to enable automatic installation of apps when you activate your device and with your consent at later times. This software will collect certain usage information about the apps it installs, including first open and uninstall events. You can delete or disable these apps at any time.

Verizon Wireless does not publish directories of our customers' wireless phone numbers, and we do not provide or make them available to third parties for listing in directories unless you request that we do so.

##### Information about the Cable Act

To the extent that Section 631 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (the "Cable Act") applies to services you purchase, it entitles you to know about the personally identifiable information a cable service provider collects. This includes the nature of the use and disclosure of this information and to whom it may be disclosed, how long personally identifiable information is maintained, and how subscribers may access it. In addition, the Cable Act imposes limits on the collection and disclosure of personal information and gives subscribers the ability to enforce their privacy rights. (Personally identifiable information does not include aggregate data that does not identify a particular person).

The Cable Act allows a provider to use its cable system to collect personally identifiable information necessary to render a cable service or other services provided to subscribers and to detect and prevent unauthorized access to services. Additional personally identifiable information may be collected with the subscriber's prior consent. Personally identifiable information may be used or disclosed without the subscriber's consent where necessary to render services, and to conduct legitimate business activities related to services provided.

We may be required by law to disclose personally identifiable information to a governmental entity to comply with valid legal process, such as warrants, court orders or subpoenas, but we will not disclose records revealing your selection of video programming unless we receive a court order indicating that the governmental entity has made a specified showing of relevance and you were afforded an opportunity to contest the order. We may be required to disclose personally identifiable information (including your selection of video programming) to a non-governmental entity to comply with a court order, after you have been provided notice.

If you believe that your privacy rights have been violated, please [e-mail us][160] and we will work with you to address your concerns. If you believe that you have been aggrieved as a result of a violation of the Cable Act, you may enforce the limitations imposed by the Cable Act through a civil action in a United States district court seeking damages, attorney's fees, and litigation costs. Other rights and remedies may also be available to you under federal or other applicable laws.

The Cable Act permits the disclosure of customer names and addresses as long as a subscriber has been provided with the opportunity to prohibit or limit this disclosure and the disclosure does not reveal, directly or indirectly, the subscriber's viewing or other uses of the cable or other services provided. If we intend to share data in this way, we will provide you with the opportunity to prohibit or limit this type of sharing.

##### Additional Information for hum service

hum service includes vehicle diagnostics, vehicle location assistance, one-button emergency calling, automated alerts to emergency personnel when a potential accident is detected, and roadside assistance services as well as possible discounts on travel, automotive, car rental and other offers. When installed in your car, the hum system collects information about your vehicle's performance and maintenance characteristics, as well as vehicle location and use information (including trip distances, acceleration, deceleration, turning, speed and revolutions per minute). In addition to other uses described in this policy, this information will be used to develop and provide a driving tips feature planned for introduction in 2016. This feature is expected to rate your overall driving and suggest ways in which driving could potentially be improved.

Information that identifies your vehicle and other personal information may be shared as described in the information sharing sections of this policy as well as when it is necessary to provide various hum service features, such as alerting emergency personnel of your location if a crash is detected, helping authorities locate your vehicle if you report it stolen or helping roadside assistance locate your vehicle.

hum information may also be used on its own or in combination with other Verizon information to determine aggregate insights about hum users.  For example, a company may find it valuable to know the number of vehicles on different roads at various times during the day and the percent of drivers of those vehicles that are in a certain age range.  hum information may also be shared with third parties in a way that does not identify you personally.  For example, it may be used  to provide traffic reporting and similar services or to inform car manufacturers about characteristics of different vehicle models.

##### Advertising and insight programs

| ----- |
|

##### Relevant Mobile Advertising Program

 |  Beginning in November 2015, the Verizon Wireless [Relevant Mobile Advertising][159] program will be combined into the [AOL Advertising Network][161] to help make marketing you see more personalized and useful to you across the devices and services you use.  
    
The Relevant Mobile Advertising program uses your postal and email addresses; certain information about your Verizon Wireless products and services such as your device type; and demographic and interest categories we get from other companies such as your gender, age range and interests (i.e. sports fan, frequent diner or pet owner). The AOL Advertising Network uses information collected when you use AOL services and visit third-party websites where AOL provides advertising services (such as web browsing, app usage and location), as well as information that AOL obtains from third-party partners and advertisers. The combined advertising program will use online and device identifiers including AOL browser cookies, advertising IDs from Apple and Google, and one created by Verizon, known as a [Unique Identifier Header or UIDH][158].   
  
We do not share information that identifies you personally as part of these programs other than with vendors and partners who do work for us. We require that these vendors and partners protect the information and use it only for the services they are providing us. [You have a choice about participating in this program.][162] |
|

##### Business and Marketing Insights

 |  Verizon Wireless uses certain customer information to create aggregate business and marketing insights. The program uses Information about how you use your mobile device, including web browsing, apps and features you use and the location of your device, as well as certain information about your Verizon products and services (such as device type and amount of use) and information we obtain from other companies (such as gender, age range and interests). We may combine this information in a manner that does not personally identify you and use it to prepare aggregated business and marketing insight that we may use ourselves or share with others for their use. We may also share location information with others in a way that does not personally identify you so that they may produce aggregate business and marketing reports. You have a choice about whether your information is included in these reports. |
|

##### Relevant Online Advertising

 |  The Relevant Online Advertising program helps advertisers better reach our wireline Internet access customers using the postal address we have for you; certain information about your Verizon products and services – such as device type and broadband service features; and demographic and interest information provided to us by other companies – such as gender, age-range, sports fan, frequent diner or pet owner. This information is used to predict whether you fit within an audience an advertiser is trying to reach. We do not share information that identifies you personally as part of these programs other than with vendors and partners who do work for us. We require that these vendors and partners protect the information and use it only for the services they are providing us. [You have a choice about participating in this program.][163] |
|

##### Relevant TV Advertising

 |  Verizon's Relevant TV Advertising program helps advertisers reach Fios television customers with advertisements that may be more relevant to their interests. We do not share information that identifies you personally as part of these programs other than with vendors and partners who do work for us. We require that these vendors and partners protect the information and use it only for the services they are providing us. The ads may appear on a variety of platforms where Fios television customers can access video content. We help advertisers deliver ads to audiences based on demographic and interest information (such as gender, family size, and luxury car owner) we obtain from other companies, your address and certain information about your Verizon products and services (such as service packages purchased, video on-demand purchases and program viewing data). [You have a choice about receiving this type of advertising and you can opt out online][164]. |

#####  

##### Additional information for AOL services

AOL products and services include online services such as AOL.com, The Huffington Post, TechCrunch and Mapquest; AOL Mail and AIM; and advertising services, including ONE by AOL and Advertising.com. Many of AOL's free services are supported by the ads displayed on those services. AOL also provides a variety of online advertising services to other companies that place ads on our services and elsewhere.

The [AOL Privacy Policy][152] provides additional information about the collection and use of information from any devices you use to access or connect to AOL branded websites, services and software as well as many websites owned by or affiliated with AOL and operating under different names. It also describes the collection and use of information by AOL Advertising and your related choices. In the event of a conflict between this Privacy Policy and the AOL Privacy Policy, the AOL Privacy Policy will control when you are on an AOL site or using an AOL product or service.  
 

### Information we share

##### Information shared within the Verizon family of companies:

Verizon shares customer information within our family of companies for a variety of purposes, including, for example, providing you with the latest information about our products and services and offering you our latest promotions. You can limit the sharing of certain types of customer information, known as Customer Proprietary Network Information, or CPNI, within the Verizon family of companies for marketing services to you other than your current services.

Customer Proprietary Network Information (CPNI) is information that relates to the type, quantity, destination, technical configuration, location, amount of use and related billing information of your telecommunications or interconnected Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) services. Federal law governs our use and sharing of CPNI.

##### Information shared outside the Verizon family of companies:

Except as explained in this Privacy Policy, in privacy policies for specific services, or in agreements with our customers, Verizon does not sell, license or share information that individually identifies our customers, people using our networks, or website visitors with others outside the Verizon family of companies that are not performing work on Verizon's behalf without the consent of the person whose information will be shared.

Verizon uses vendors and partners for a variety of business purposes such as to help us offer, provide, repair, restore and bill for services we provide. We share information with those vendors and partners when it is necessary for them to perform work on our behalf. For example, we may provide your credit card information and billing address to our payment processing company solely for the purpose of processing payment for a transaction you have requested. We require that these vendors and partners protect the customer information we provide to them and limit their use of Verizon customer data to the purposes for which it was provided. We do not permit these types of vendors and partners to use this information for their own marketing purposes.

As described in more detail in other sections of this policy, Verizon also may share certain information with outside companies-, for example, to assist with the delivery of advertising campaigns, or preparing and sharing aggregate reports. This information does not identify Verizon customers individually.

Verizon provides the names, addresses and telephone numbers of wireline telephone customers to directory publishers and directory assistance services unless a non-published or non-listed phone number has been requested.

We may disclose information that individually identifies our customers or identifies customer devices in certain circumstances, such as:

* to comply with valid legal process including subpoenas, court orders or search warrants, and as otherwise authorized by law; in cases involving danger of death or serious physical injury to any person or other emergencies;
* to protect our rights or property, or the safety of our customers or employees;
* to protect against fraudulent, malicious, abusive, unauthorized or unlawful use of or subscription to our products and services and to protect our network, services, devices and users from such use;
* to advance or defend against complaints or legal claims in court, administrative proceedings and elsewhere;
* to credit bureaus or collection agencies to determine credit risk, for reporting purposes or to obtain payment for Verizon-billed products and services;
* to a third-party that you have authorized to verify your account information;
* to outside auditors and regulators; or
* with your consent.

When you purchase services offered jointly by Verizon and one of our partners, customer information may be received by both Verizon and our partner that is providing your service. For these jointly offered services, you should also review the partner company's privacy policy which may include practices that are different from the practices described here.

If Verizon enters into a merger, acquisition or sale of all or a portion of its assets or business, customer information will also be transferred as part of or in connection with the transaction.

##### Information provided to or used by third-party advertising entities or social networks

You may see third-party advertisements on some Verizon websites, services, apps and devices. Some advertisements are chosen by companies that operate on our sites and other sites (for example, ad servers, ad networks, or technology platforms) to place ads on behalf of advertisers. These companies may place and access cookies on your device to collect information about your visit on websites, including ours. The information they collect from our sites is in a form that does not identify you personally and may be combined with similar data they obtain from other websites and apps to help advertisers better reach audiences they wish to target. Targeting may be accomplished by tailoring advertising to interests that they infer from your interactions on our sites and your interaction with other sites and services where these companies also are present. AOL also provides these types of services to advertisers; more information is described in the [AOL privacy policy.][152]

If you choose to interact with specific advertisers who advertise on our apps sites or services, the information you provide to them is subject to the conditions of their specific privacy policies.

Advertising that is customized based on predictions generated from your visits over time and across different websites is sometimes called "online behavioral" or "interest-based" advertising. In accordance with [industry self-regulatory principles][156], we require that companies disclose when they are using online behavioral advertising programs to deliver third-party ads on our sites or collecting information about your visit to our sites for these purposes and give consumers the ability to opt out of this use of their information. You will see an icon ![][157] in or around third-party advertisements that are delivered on our sites using behavioral advertising programs. Clicking on this icon will provide additional information about the companies and data practices that were used to deliver the ad as well as information on how you may opt out of these advertising programs. Additional information about your options regarding the use of your information for advertising purposes can be found below[. View additional information about online behavioral advertising][156]. Please note that Verizon does not have control over or access to information contained in the cookies that are set on your computer by ad servers, ad networks or third-party advertisers. [View information about "cookies" and related technologies][155]

We also may permit advertisers on our sites, apps and services to place ads based on certain information we have about your Verizon products and services as well as geographic and demographic data. Information used for this purpose does not identify you individually.

Verizon websites and services my include social network or other third-party plug-ins and widgets that may provide information to their associated social networks or third-parties about your interactions with Verizon pages you visit or services you use, even if you do not click on or otherwise interact with the plug-in or widget. [View information about "cookies" and related technologies][155]

If you would like to be removed from the Verizon Wireless telemarketing list, please contact us at 1-800-922-0204.

You may opt out of receiving marketing-related postal mailings or prevent door-to-door marketing solicitations from Verizon by calling 1-800-VERIZON. You may opt out of receiving marketing-related postal mailing or prevent text message marketing by Verizon Wireless by calling 1-800-922-0204.

Please note that Verizon may use bulk mail service for some marketing mailings. These services deliver offers to all homes in a neighborhood or zip code. This type of mailing will continue even if you opt out of receiving marketing-related postal mailings from Verizon.

##### Information used for online advertising

You have choices about whether certain information collected on websites, including Verizon's, is used to customize advertising based on predictions generated from your visits over time and across different websites and apps. When you see this icon ![][157] in or around an advertisement you can click on the icon to see additional information on the companies and data practices that were used to deliver the ad and descriptions of how you may opt out of these advertising programs. You may also visit [Digital Advertising Alliance's Consumer Choices][156] to learn more or to limit the collection of information by these parties. Similarly, many mobile devices offer controls you can set to limit the advertising use of information collected across mobile apps on your device. AOL also provides these types of services to advertisers, more information is described in the[ AOL privacy policy][152].

Please note that many opt outs use browser cookies or device controls and are specific to the device and browser you are using. If you buy a new computer, change web browsers or devices or delete the cookies on your computer, you may need to opt out again. In addition, ads you receive may still be tailored using other techniques such as publisher, device or browser-enabled targeting. You should check the privacy policies of the products, sites, apps and services you use to learn more about any such techniques and your options.

You also can limit the collection of certain website information by deleting or disabling cookies. Most computers' Internet browsers enable you to erase cookies from your computer hard drive, block all cookies, or receive a warning before a cookie is stored. Disabling cookies may prevent you from using specific features on our sites and other websites, such as ordering products or services and maintaining an online account. Cookies must be enabled for you to use your Verizon e-mail account. [View information about "cookies" and related technologies][155]

##### Business and Marketing Insights

You may opt out by calling 1-866-211-0874 or by visiting[ your privacy choices page in My Verizon][169]. Please note that if you have multi-line account, you should indicate your opt out choice for each line. If you add a line or change a telephone number, you will need to update your privacy choices.

### Working together to keep children safe.

Verizon recognizes that online service providers must be vigilant in protecting the safety and privacy of children online. We do not knowingly market to or solicit information from children under the age of 13 without obtaining verifiable parental consent.

To learn more about AOL's information practices with respect to children under 13, please review [AOL's Important Note to Parents][170].

Regrettably, there are those who use the Internet to view, store and distribute child pornography (or who engage in other types of illegal activity involving children). Child pornography is subject to severe criminal penalties and using the Verizon network to view, store or distribute it violates our service contracts. The Verizon network may not be used by customers in any manner for the storage, transmission or dissemination of images containing child pornography and we will report any instances of such activity of which we become aware to the appropriate law enforcement authorities.

If you have a complaint about child pornography, the soliciting of children for sexual activity, or any other illegal or inappropriate activity involving children on a Verizon service, report it to us by [sending an e-mail][171]. Please include the words "child porn" in the subject line of your email. You can also make a report directly to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children through [CyberTipline][172].

Additional Internet safety resources and information are available at:

### Information security and data retention

Verizon has technical, administrative and physical safeguards in place to help protect against unauthorized access to, use or disclosure of customer information we collect or store, including social security numbers. Employees are trained on the importance of protecting privacy and on the proper access to, use and disclosure of customer information. Under our practices and policies, access to sensitive personally identifiable information is authorized only for those who have a business need for such access. Personally identifiable and other sensitive records are retained only as long as reasonably necessary for business, accounting, tax or legal purposes.

Although we work hard to protect personal information that we collect and store, no program is 100% secure and we cannot guarantee that our safeguards will prevent every unauthorized attempt to access, use or disclose personal information. Verizon maintains security and incident response plans to handle incidents involving unauthorized access to private information we collect or store.

If you become aware of a security issue, please contact [Verizon's Security Control Center][174]. We will work with you to address any problems.

Verizon often publishes helpful information about a wide range of scams that you may encounter. [Learn more about Internet and phone scams and tips on how to protect yourself][175]  
 

### Accessing and updating your information

We strive to keep our customer records as accurate as possible. You may correct or update your Verizon customer information by calling a Verizon customer service representative at 1-800-VERIZON or by accessing your account online and providing the updated information there. Similarly, updates can be made to your Verizon Wireless account by calling a Verizon Wireless customer service representative at 1-800-922-0204 or [contact us online][176]. Verizon Enterprise Services customers may update their information by contacting their account manager. Verizon Vehicle customers may change or update their contact information by calling 1-800-711-5800. Registered AOL users may access and update their registration information and any billing or shipping information by visiting [My Account][177].

Fios and other customers served over our fiber-to-the-premises network who would like to see their personally identifiable information, may [e-mail us][160] to arrange a time and convenient location to do so during business hours. You will need to provide proper identification and you may examine records that contain personally identifiable information about you and no one else. If you believe any of your personally identifiable information is inaccurate, we will work with you to ensure that corrections are made. Verizon reserves the right to charge you for the cost of photocopying any documents you request.  
 

### Links to and from non-Verizon websites and content

Verizon websites, apps and platforms may contain links to non-Verizon sites and Verizon apps or other content may be included on web pages and web sites that are not associated with Verizon and over which we have no control. We are not responsible for the content on these sites or platforms or the privacy policies and practices employed by these sites and platforms. We recommend that you review the policies and practices of the sites you visit.  
 

### Information sharing: Blogs and social networking

Some Verizon websites, apps and services may allow you to participate in web log ("blog") discussions, message boards, chat rooms, and other forms of social networking and to post reviews. Please be aware that these forums are accessible to others. We urge you to not submit any personally identifiable information to these forums because any information you post can be read, collected, shared, or otherwise used by anyone who accesses the forum. Verizon is not responsible for the information you choose to submit in these forums. If you post content to information sharing forums, including any information about the movies you rent or view, you are doing so by choice and you are providing consent to the disclosure of this information.  
 

### Changes to this policy

We reserve the right to make changes to this privacy policy, so please check back periodically for changes. You will be able to see that changes have been made by checking to see the effective date posted at the end of the policy. If Verizon elects to use or disclose information that identifies you as an individual in a manner that is materially different from that stated in our policy at the time we collected that information from you, we will give you a choice regarding such use or disclosure by appropriate means, which may include use of an opt out mechanism.
