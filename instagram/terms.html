You will cooperate as fully required by Instagram in the defense of any claim. Instagram reserves the right to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter subject to indemnification by you, and you will not in any event settle any claim without the prior written consent of Instagram. </div><div class="_1sr9"><h3 class="_1sra">Arbitration</h3><p class="_1vk"></p> Except if you opt-out or for disputes relating to: (1) your or Instagram's intellectual property (such as trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights and patents); (2) violations of the API Terms; or (3) violations of provisions 13 or 15 of the Basic Terms, above ("Excluded Disputes"), you agree that all disputes between you and Instagram (whether or not such dispute involves a third party) with regard to your relationship with Instagram, including without limitation disputes related to these Terms of Use, your use of the Service, and/or rights of privacy and/or publicity, will be resolved by binding, individual arbitration under the American Arbitration Association's rules for arbitration of consumer-related disputes and you and Instagram hereby expressly waive trial by jury. As an alternative, you may bring your claim in your local "small claims" court, if permitted by that small claims court's rules. You may bring claims only on your own behalf. Neither you nor Instagram will participate in a class action or class-wide arbitration for any claims covered by this agreement. You also agree not to participate in claims brought in a private attorney general or representative capacity, or consolidated claims involving another person's account, if Instagram is a party to the proceeding. This dispute resolution provision will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act. In the event the American Arbitration Association is unwilling or unable to set a hearing date within one hundred and sixty (160) days of filing the case, then either Instagram or you can elect to have the arbitration administered instead by the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having competent jurisdiction. Any provision of applicable law notwithstanding, the arbitrator will not have authority to award damages, remedies or awards that conflict with these Terms of Use. <br><br> You may opt out of this agreement to arbitrate. If you do so, neither you nor Instagram can require the other to participate in an arbitration proceeding. To opt out, you must notify Instagram in writing within 30 days of the date that you first became subject to this arbitration provision. You must use this address to opt out: <br><br> Instagram, LLC ATTN: Arbitration Opt-out 1601 Willow Rd. Menlo Park, CA 94025 <br><br> You must include your name and residence address, the email address you use for your Instagram account, and a clear statement that you want to opt out of this arbitration agreement. <br><br> If the prohibition against class actions and other claims brought on behalf of third parties contained above is found to be unenforceable, then all of the preceding language in this Arbitration section will be null and void. This arbitration agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Instagram. </div><div class="_1sr9"><h3 class="_1sra">Time Limitation on Claims</h3><p class="_1vk"></p> You agree that any claim you may have arising out of or related to your relationship with Instagram must be filed within one year after such claim arose; otherwise, your claim is permanently barred. </div><div class="_1sr9"><h3 class="_1sra">Governing Law &amp; Venue</h3><p class="_1vk"></p> These Terms of Use are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, without giving effect to any principles of conflicts of law AND WILL SPECIFICALLY NOT BE GOVERNED BY THE UNITED NATIONS CONVENTIONS ON CONTRACTS FOR THE INTERNATIONAL SALE OF GOODS, IF OTHERWISE APPLICABLE. For any action at law or in equity relating to the arbitration provision of these Terms of Use, the Excluded Disputes or if you opt out of the agreement to arbitrate, you agree to resolve any dispute you have with Instagram exclusively in a state or federal court located in Santa Clara, California, and to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located in Santa Clara County for the purpose of litigating all such disputes. <br><br> If any provision of these Terms of Use is held to be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable during arbitration or by a court of competent jurisdiction, then that provision will be deemed severable from these Terms of Use and will not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. Instagram's failure to insist upon or enforce strict performance of any provision of these Terms will not be construed as a waiver of any provision or right. No waiver of any of these Terms will be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or condition or any other term or condition. Instagram reserves the right to change this dispute resolution provision, but any such changes will not apply to disputes arising before the effective date of the amendment. This dispute resolution provision will survive the termination of any or all of your transactions with Instagram. </div><div class="_1sr9"><h3 class="_1sra">Entire Agreement</h3><p class="_1vk"></p> If you are using the Service on behalf of a legal entity, you represent that you are authorized to enter into an agreement on behalf of that legal entity. These Terms of Use constitute the entire agreement between you and Instagram and governs your use of the Service, superseding any prior agreements between you and Instagram. You will not assign the Terms of Use or assign any rights or delegate any obligations hereunder, in whole or in part, whether voluntarily or by operation of law, without the prior written consent of Instagram. Any purported assignment or delegation by you without the appropriate prior written consent of Instagram will be null and void. Instagram may assign these Terms of Use or any rights hereunder without your consent. If any provision of these Terms of Use is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or otherwise unenforceable, the parties nevertheless agree that such portion will be deemed severable from these Terms of Use and will not affect the validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions, and the remaining provisions of the Terms of Use remain in full force and effect. Neither the course of conduct between the parties nor trade practice will act to modify the Terms of Use. These Terms of Use do not confer any third-party beneficiary rights. </div><div class="_1sr9"><h3 class="_1sra">Territorial Restrictions</h3><p class="_1vk"></p> The information provided within the Service is not intended for distribution to or use by any person or entity in any jurisdiction or country where such distribution or use would be contrary to law or regulation or which would subject Instagram to any registration requirement within such jurisdiction or country. We reserve the right to limit the availability of the Service or any portion of the Service, to any person, geographic area, or jurisdiction, at any time and in our sole discretion, and to limit the quantities of any content, program, product, service or other feature that Instagram provides. <br><br> Software related to or made available by the Service may be subject to United States export controls. Thus, no software from the Service may be downloaded, exported or re-exported: (a) into (or to a national or resident of) any country to which the United States has embargoed goods; or (b) to anyone on the U.S. Treasury Department's list of Specially Designated Nationals or the U.S. Commerce Department's Table of Deny Orders. By downloading any software related to the Service, you represent and warrant that you are not located in, under the control of, or a national or resident of, any such country or on any such list. <br><br> The effective date of these Terms of Use is January 19, 2013. These Terms of Use were written in English (US). To the extent any translated version of these Terms of Use conflicts with the English version, the English version controls. </div></div></div></div></div><div class="_1ewr clearfix"><div class="_41bx"><nav><ul><li><a href="http://instagram.com/about/us/">About us</a></li><li><a href="http://help.instagram.com/">Help</a></li><li><a href="http://instagram.com/developers/">API</a></li><li><a href="http://instagram.com/about/jobs/">Jobs</a></li><li><a href="http://blog.instagram.com/">Blog</a></li><li><a href="http://instagram.com/legal/terms/">Terms</a></li><li><a href="http://instagram.com/legal/privacy/">Privacy</a></li></ul></nav><p class="_41by"> © 2016 Instagram, Inc. </p></div></div></div><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/(function(){function si_cj(m){setTimeout(function(){new Image().src="https:\/\/error.facebook.com\/common\/scribe_endpoint.php?c=si_clickjacking&t=7964"+"&m="+m;},5000);}if(top!=self && !false){try{if(parent!=top){throw 1;}var si_cj_d=["apps.facebook.com","apps.beta.facebook.com"];var href=top.location.href.toLowerCase();for(var i=0;i<si_cj_d.length;i++){if (href.indexOf(si_cj_d[i])>=0){throw 1;}}si_cj("3 http:\/\/help.instagram.com\/");}catch(e){si_cj("1 \thttp:\/\/help.instagram.com\/");window.document.write("\u003Cstyle>body * {display:none !important;}\u003C\/style>\u003Ca href=\"#\" onclick=\"top.location.href=window.location.href\" style=\"display:block !important;padding:10px\">Go to Facebook.com\u003C\/a>");/*RxTDBcb7*/}}}())/*]]>*/</script>
