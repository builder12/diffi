<h4>Information You Give Us</h4>
<p>You do not have to provide the White House with any personal
information or create a user account to access information on
WhiteHouse.gov. However, for some services, we may need some
personal information from you such as your name, address, telephone
number, and email address. For example:</p>
<ul><li>The <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/contact/submit-questions-and-comments">“Contact
the White House” form</a> asks for basic contact information so we
can respond to your request;</li>
<li>When we ask users to share their story or how a policy decision
will impact them, we generally ask for their name, zip code, and
email address;</li>
<li>Creating a user account for our online petitions platform
<a href="http://petitions.whitehouse.gov">“We the People”</a>
requires a valid email address and a first and last name; and</li>
<li>We may ask for personal information from people applying to,
registering for, or participating in a White House event or
competition.</li>
</ul><h4><a name="visits-to-whitehouse-gov"/>Visits to
WhiteHouse.gov</h4>
<p>When you visit WhiteHouse.gov, the following basic information
is automatically received and stored by the web servers hosting
WhiteHouse.gov:</p>


<ul><li>The internet <a href="#domain">domain name</a>;</li>
<li>Information about your computer or mobile set-up (e.g., type
and version of web browser, operating system, screen resolution,
and connection speed);</li>
<li>The pages on WhiteHouse.gov that you visit;</li>
<li>The internet address, or URL, of the website that connected you
to our site, if you accessed WhiteHouse.gov via a link on another
page (i.e., “referral traffic”); and</li>
<li>The amount of data transmitted from WhiteHouse.gov to your
computer.</li>
</ul>
<p>The White House also uses web measurement and customization
technologies (such as “<a href="#cookies">cookies"</a>). You can
choose not to accept cookies from any website, including
WhiteHouse.gov, by changing your browser settings. <a href="/privacy/cookies">Click here to learn more about how we use
cookies</a>.</p>
<h4>Using the WhiteHouse.gov Mobile Application</h4>
<p>When you use the WhiteHouse.gov <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/mobile">Mobile Application</a> (“App”),
the App pulls content from the White House website, generating the
same basic information as when you visit WhiteHouse.gov (see
<a href="#visits-to-whitehouse-gov">Visits to WhiteHouse.gov</a>).
The WhiteHouse.gov Mobile App does not collect geolocation
information or use location services.</p>

<p>You may sign up to receive “push notification” messages via a
third party provider (currently Urban Airship). To make sure
messages reach the correct devices, our third party provider relies
on a <a href="#device">device token</a> unique to your mobile
device. While we may be able to access a list of the tokens, the
App and tokens do not reveal your identity, unique device ID, or
contact information to us. If, at any time, you wish to stop
receiving push notifications, simply adjust your phone settings or
remove the App.</p>
<p>The White House receives aggregate data about the use of our
App, such as the number of people who have opened the App from a
third party provider (currently Google Analytics). We also receive
aggregate data from the platforms that distribute our App
(currently the iTunes Store and Google Play Store), such as the
number of people who download the App and mobile set-up information
(e.g., device model, App version, country, language, and mobile
carrier). Please consult the privacy policies of these third
parties for further information.</p>
<h4>Email Subscriptions</h4>
<p>In order to manage White House email subscription lists, we
retain the names and email address of our email subscribers, as
well as other information they may have shared with us (e.g.,
addresses and phone numbers), logs of emails we send, and
automatically generated email data used to improve our email
communications. This automatically generated email data (generated
through simple tools such as “pixel tags” and link redirects)
includes:</p>

<ul><li>The recipient’s <a href="#email-client">email client</a>;</li>
<li>Whether the email was opened;</li>
<li>If a link in the message was clicked;</li>
<li>Whether an email was delivered;</li>
<li>If the email was forwarded; and</li>
<li>If the email was printed.</li>
</ul><p>If, at any time, you wish to stop receiving our messages, simply
click on the “Unsubscribe” link at the bottom of each email
message.</p>
<h4>Third-Party Websites</h4>
<p>The White House maintains official pages or accounts on
third-party websites in order to better engage with the American
public (<a href="/privacy/current-third-party-pages">a current list
is here</a>). Your activity on those sites is governed by the
third-party website’s security and privacy policies. Users of
third-party sites often share information with the general public,
user community, and/or the third-party operating the site.
Consequently, you should review the privacy policies of third-party
sites before using them and ensure that you understand how your
information may be shared and used. You should also adjust privacy
settings on your account on any third-party site to match your
preferences.</p>
<p>For the sole purpose of complying with the <a href="http://www.archives.gov/about/laws/presidential-records.html" target="_blank">Presidential Records Act</a>, the White House
archives some information that users submit or publish when
engaging with the White House through official White House pages or
accounts on third-party websites (e.g., by sending a message,
posting a comment, “following,” “friending,” or taking similar
actions). This information may contain personal information, such
as an individual’s username and other public account information,
when such information is available based on the user’s privacy
settings and the terms of the site. For example:</p>
<ul><li>On Twitter, the White House automatically archives “tweets”
from official White House accounts, “direct messages” sent to or
from official White House accounts, and “mentions” (tweets from
other users to official White House accounts; these tweets contain
an @ and the username of an official White House account (e.g.,
<a href="http://www.twitter.com/whitehouse">@WhiteHouse</a>). The
White House also automatically archives any status that official
accounts have “favorited.”</li>
<li>On Facebook, the White House automatically archives all content
created by official White House pages, content that tags an
official White House page, and any content posted on official White
House pages (for example, the number of likes to the page and
comments posted).</li>
<li>On Google+, the White House automatically archives all content
posted by official White House accounts, as well as the number of
likes/comments/shares on each of those posts (including the
comments themselves). The White House also automatically archives
the total number of Google+ users that have added our page to a
“Circle,” and the list of users that White House accounts have
added to “Circles.”</li>
</ul><p>For aggregate statistical analysis and to improve the quality of
our services, we may integrate web measurement tools with our
social media pages. These tools enable basic analysis of social
media traffic (such as the number of people visiting a certain
page) and do not collect personally identifiable information.</p>
