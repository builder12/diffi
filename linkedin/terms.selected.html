        <p>You agree that the laws of the State of California, U.S.A., excluding its conflict of laws rules, shall exclusively govern any dispute relating to this Agreement and/or the Services.

    <div class="row first last">
      <div class="brief-copy">
        <p>Here are some important details about how to read the Agreement.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="full-copy">
        <p>If a court with authority over this Agreement finds any part of it not enforceable, you and us agree that the court should modify the terms to make that part enforceable while still achieving its intent.  If the court cannot do that, you and us agree to ask the court to remove that unenforceable part and still enforce the rest of this Agreement.  To the extent allowed by law, the English version of this Agreement is binding and other translations are for convenience only.  This Agreement (including additional terms that may be provided by us when you engage with a feature of the Services) is the only agreement between us regarding the Services and supersedes all prior agreements for the Services.</p>
        <p>If we don&apos;t act to enforce a breach of this Agreement, that does not mean that LinkedIn has waived its right to enforce this Agreement.  You may not assign or transfer this Agreement (or your membership or use of Services) to anyone without our consent.  However, you agree that LinkedIn may assign this Agreement to its affiliates or a party that buys it without your consent.  There are no third party beneficiaries to this Agreement.</p>
        <p>We reserve the right to change the terms of this Agreement and will provide you notice if we do and we agree that changes cannot be retroactive.  If you don&apos;t agree to these changes, you must stop using the Services.</p>
        <p>You agree that the only way to provide us legal notice is at the addresses provided in Section 10.</p>
