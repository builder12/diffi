            <h1> Lyft Terms of Service</h1>

            <p>
                <time>February 8, 2016</time>
            </p>
            <p class="uppercase"> This following user agreement describes the terms and conditions on which Lyft, Inc.
                offers you access to the Lyft platform. </p>
        </header>
        <section>
            <p>These terms of service constitute a legally binding agreement (the &#x201C;Agreement&#x201D;) between you (&#x201C;you,&#x201D; or
                &#x201C;your&#x201D;) and Lyft, Inc. (&#x201C;Lyft,&#x201D; &#x201C;we,&#x201D; &#x201C;us&#x201D; or &#x201C;our&#x201D;), a Delaware corporation, governing your use of the
                Lyft application, website, and technology platform (collectively, the &#x201C;Lyft Platform&#x201D;). </p>

            <p>The Lyft Platform provides a marketplace where persons who seek transportation to certain destinations
                (&#x201C;Riders&#x201D;) can be matched with persons driving to or through those destinations (&#x201C;Drivers&#x201D;). Drivers and
                Riders are collectively referred to herein as &#x201C;Users&#x201D; and each User shall create a User account that
                enables such User to access the Lyft Platform. For purposes of this Agreement, the driving services
                provided by Drivers to Riders that are matched through the Platform shall be referred to collectively as
                the &#x201C;Services&#x201D;. </p>

            <p class="uppercase">Lyft does not provide transportation services, and Lyft is not a transportation
                carrier. It is up to the Driver to decide whether or not to offer a ride to a Rider contacted through
                the Lyft Platform, and it is up to the Rider to decide whether or not to accept a ride from any Driver
                contacted through the Lyft Platform. Any decision by a User to offer or accept Services once such User
                is matched through the Lyft Platform is a decision made in such User&#x2019;s sole discretion. Each
                transportation Service provided by a Driver to a Rider shall constitute a separate agreement between
                such persons. </p>

            <p>By creating your User account and using the Lyft Platform, you expressly acknowledge that you understand
                this Agreement and accept all of its terms.
                <span class="uppercase">If you do not agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
                    you may not use or access the Lyft Platform or the Services.</span>

            <h2>Modification to the Agreement</h2>

            <p>We reserve the right to modify the terms and conditions of this Agreement at any time, effective upon
                posting the amended terms on this site. If we make changes, we will notify you by, at a minimum,
                revising the &#x201C;Last Updated&#x201D; date at the top of this Agreement. You are responsible for regularly
                reviewing this Agreement. Continued use of the Lyft Platform or Services after any such changes shall
                constitute your consent to such changes. If you do not agree to any such changes you may not use or
                access the Lyft Platform or the Services. </p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Eligibility</h2>

            <p>The Lyft Platform is available only to, and may only be used by individuals who can form legally binding
                contracts under applicable law. Without limiting the foregoing, the Lyft Platform is not available to
                children (persons under the age of 18) or Users who have had their User account temporarily or
                permanently deactivated. By becoming a User, you represent and warrant that you are at least 18 years
                old and that you have the right, authority and capacity to enter into and abide by the terms and
                conditions of this Agreement. </p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Payments</h2>

            <p>As a Rider, you agree that any amounts charged following a ride (a &#x201C;Charge&#x201D;) are mandatory and due and
                payable immediately upon completion of the ride. Charges include Ride Fees and other applicable fees,
                tolls, surcharges, and taxes as set forth on your market&#x2019;s Lyft Cities page
                (<a href="https://www.lyft.com/cities">https://www.lyft.com/cities</a>), plus any tips to the Driver
                that you elect to pay. Lyft has the authority and reserves the right to determine and modify pricing by
                posting applicable Charges to your market&#x2019;s Lyft Cities page. Charges may vary based on the type of
                service you request (e.g., Lyft Plus, Lyft SUV) as described on your market&#x2019;s Lyft Cities page. You are
                responsible for reviewing the applicable Lyft Cities page and shall be responsible for all Charges
                incurred under your User account regardless of your awareness of such Charges or the amounts thereof. In
                all markets, Charges are subject to maximum limits as set forth in your market&#x2019;s Lyft Cities page.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Ride Fees. Ride Fees consist of a base price and incremental charges based on the duration and
                    distance of your ride. For particularly short rides, minimum Ride Fees may apply. For Lyft Line
                    rides and select routes, Ride Fees may be quoted in advance. Ride Fees may be subject to a
                    multiplier at times of high demand of the Services (&#x201C;Prime Time&#x201D;) as determined by Lyft. We will use
                    reasonable efforts to inform you of any Prime Time multipliers in effect at the time you request a
                    ride.
                </li>
                <li>Trust &amp; Service Fee. Lyft may assess a per-ride &#x201C;Trust &amp; Service Fee&#x201D; to offset Lyft&#x2019;s
                    expenses, including but not limited to those related to promoting trust and safety on the Lyft
                    platform as well as other operational costs of running the Lyft Platform. Such expenses are dynamic
                    and may or may not exceed Lyft&#x2019;s Trust &amp; Service Fee collections in certain markets. Excess Trust
                    &amp; Service Fee collections, if any, will be deemed general revenue.
                </li>
                <li>Cancellation Fee. In the event that you cancel a ride request on the Lyft Platform more than 5
                    minutes after such request is made, make repeated or frequent cancellations, or fail to show up for
                    your ride in a timely manner, you agree to pay a &#x201C;Cancellation Fee&#x201D;. We may also assess a
                    Cancellation Fee against you if we suspect that you have intentionally cancelled rides to disrupt
                    the Lyft Platform or the provision of Services.
                </li>
                <li>Damage Fee. If a Driver reports that you have materially damaged the Driver&apos;s vehicle, you agree to
                    pay a &#x201C;Damage Fee&#x201D; of up to $250 depending on the extent of the damage (as determined by Lyft in its
                    sole discretion), towards vehicle repair or cleaning. Lyft reserves the right (but is not obligated)
                    to verify or otherwise require documentation of damages prior to processing the Damage Fee.
                </li>
                <li>Other Charges. Other fees, tolls, and surcharges may apply to your ride, including: actual or
                    anticipated airport fees, state or local fees, tolls (and return tolls in select instances), and
                    processing fees for split payments. In addition, where required by law Lyft will collect applicable
                    taxes. See your market&#x2019;s Lyft Cities page for details on other Charges that may apply. Any tips will
                    be provided entirely to the applicable Driver.
                </li>
                <li>Facilitation of Payments. All Charges are facilitated through a third-party payment processing
                    service (e.g., Stripe, Inc., or Braintree, a division of PayPal, Inc.). Lyft may replace its
                    third-party payment processing services without notice to you. Charges shall only be made through
                    the Lyft Platform. Cash payments are strictly prohibited.
                </li>
                <li>No Refunds. Charges are assessed immediately following completion of the ride to your authorized
                    payment method. All Charges are non-refundable. This no-refund policy shall apply at all times
                    regardless of your decision to terminate usage of the Lyft Platform, any disruption to the Lyft
                    Platform or Services, or any other reason whatsoever.
                </li>
                <li>Promotions. Lyft, at its sole discretion, may make available promotions with different features to
                    any of our Riders or prospective Riders. These promotions, unless made to you, shall have no bearing
                    whatsoever on your Agreement or relationship with Lyft.
                </li>
                <li>Credit Card Authorization. Upon addition of a new payment method or each ride request, Lyft may seek
                    authorization of your selected payment method to verify your payment method, ensure the ride cost
                    will be covered, and protect against unauthorized behavior. The authorization is not a charge,
                    however, it may reduce your available credit by the authorization amount until your bank&#x2019;s next
                    processing cycle. Should the amount of our authorization exceed the total funds on deposit in your
                    account, you may be subject to overdraft of NSF charges by the bank issuing your debit or check
                    card. We cannot be held responsible for these charges and are unable to assist you in recovering
                    them from your issuing bank.

                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>As a Driver, you will receive applicable Ride Fees (net of Lyft&#x2019;s Administrative Fee, as discussed below)
                and any tips provided by Riders to you for the Services you provide. Lyft will process all payments due
                to you through its third party payments processor. You acknowledge and agree that such amounts shall not
                include any interest and will be net of any amounts that we are required to withhold by law. If you
                elect to receive payments through Lyft&#x2019;s express pay feature (which Lyft may offer to you in its sole
                discretion), you acknowledge that payments made to your debit card are provided through Cross River
                Bank,&#xA0;a New Jersey Chartered, <abbr title="Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation">FDIC</abbr> Insured
                bank, upon receiving instructions from&#xA0;Lyft&#x2019;s payment processor Stripe&#xA0;following your approval. Cross
                River Bank will make payment pursuant to its agreement with&#xA0;Stripe. All express pay funds are
                transferred to your debit card by Cross River Bank and not&#xA0;Stripe.&#xA0;You will be charged a fee for this
                express pay service as described by Lyft prior to confirmation. You expressly authorize Lyft to set the
                prices on your behalf for all Charges that apply to the provision of Services. Lyft reserves the right
                to withhold all or a portion of Ride Fees if it believes that you have attempted to defraud or abuse
                Lyft or Lyft&#x2019;s payment systems.
            </p>

            <p>In exchange for permitting you to offer your Services through the Lyft Platform and marketplace as a
                Driver, you agree to pay Lyft (and permit Lyft to retain) a fee based on each transaction in which you
                provide Services (the &#x201C;Administrative Fee&#x201D;) The amount of the applicable Administrative Fee will be
                communicated to you in an Administrative Fee schedule. Lyft reserves the right to change the
                Administrative Fee at any time in Lyft&#x2019;s discretion &#x2028;based upon local market factors, and Lyft will
                provide you with notice in the event of such change. Continued use of the Lyft Platform after any such
                change in the Administrative Fee calculation shall constitute your consent to such change.
            </p>

            <p>Lyft, at its sole discretion, may make available promotions with different features to any Drivers or
                prospective Drivers. These promotions, unless made to you, shall have no bearing whatsoever on your
                Agreement or relationship with Lyft.

                <li> You will comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations while providing Services, and you

                    any other activity in a manner that is inconsistent with your obligations under this Agreement.
                </li>
                <li> You will not attempt to defraud Lyft or Riders in connection with your provision of Services. If we
                    suspect that you have engaged in fraudulent activity we may withhold applicable Ride Fees or other
                    payments for the ride(s) in question.

                </li>
                <li>take any other action that would jeopardize or impair Lyft&#x2019;s rights as owner of the Lyft Marks or
                    the legality and/or enforceability of the Lyft Marks, including, without limitation, challenging or
                    opposing Lyft&#x2019;s ownership in the Lyft Marks;

                also have other legal rights that vary from state to state. </p>

                materially affected his settlement with the debtor.&#x201D; We reserve the right, but have no obligation, to

                Agreement must be brought in your individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any
                purported class, collective, or representative proceeding. The arbitrator may not consolidate more than

        <h1> Privacy Policy</h1>

        <p> Lyft is dedicated to protecting Your personal information and informing You about how We use it. This
            privacy policy applies to transactions and activities and data gathered through the Lyft Platform. Please
            review this privacy policy periodically as We may revise it without notice. This privacy policy was last
            revised on
            <time>December 8, 2014</time>
            . Each time You use the Lyft Platform or provide Us with information, by doing so You are accepting the

            <h2>Data We Collect From You</h2>

            <p> In order to operate the Lyft Platform and to provide You with information about products or services
                that may be of interest to You, We may collect &#x201C;personal information&#x201D; (i.e. information that could be
                used to contact You directly (without using the Lyft Platform) such as full name, postal address, phone
                number, credit/debit card information, or email address) or &#x201C;demographic information&#x201D; (i.e. information
                that You submit, or that We collect, that is not personal information; this may include, but is not
                limited to, zip code, hometown, gender, username, age/birth date, browsing history information,
                searching history information, and registration history information). We will also collect the contact

                Lyft and Your login credentials to Your social network accounts, such as Facebook and Twitter, if You
                choose to connect those accounts with your Lyft account. You represent and warrant that You have the
                authority to provide Us with any such contact information. Demographic information is divided into two
                categories: </p>
            <ol>
                <li>&#x201C;non-public information&#x201D;, which consists of ride transaction information and one-on-one
                    communications between You and other users of the Lyft Platform; and

            <h2>How We Use Personal Information</h2>

            <p> We use Your email address and Your other personal information to help Us efficiently operate the Lyft
                Platform, to contact You in connection with Your transactions and other activities on the Lyft Platform
                (including, but not limited to, confirmation emails, or important news that could affect Your
                relationship with Lyft), to forward trip information to You from other Users, to forward trip
                information from You to other Users, and to contact You and others to suggest potential matches. We use
                Your contact information to find and connect with Your friends (when instructed by You). These types of
                communications are known as &#x201C;Operational Communications.&#x201D; In some cases, Operational Communications may
                also contain commercial messages, such as banner ads and special offers. </p>

            <p> To operate the Lyft Platform, including processing Your transactions and supporting Your activities on
                the Lyft Platform, We may share Your personal information with Our agents, representatives, contractors
                and service providers so they can provide Us with support services such as email origination, receipt or
                support services, customer relationship management services, and order fulfillment. We require these
                entities not to use Your information for any other purpose. </p>

            <p> By purchasing, or registering or making reservations for, products or services offered or sponsored by
                third parties on the Lyft Platform, or electing to receive communications (such as emails or material by
                mail) or electing to participate in contests, sweepstakes or other programs (such as discount or rewards
                programs), offered or sponsored by third parties on the Lyft Platform, You consent to Our providing Your
                personal information to those third parties. Those third parties may use Your personal information in
                accordance with their own privacy policies. You will need to contact those third parties to instruct
                them directly regarding Your preferences for the use of Your personal information by them. Additionally,
                You agree that We may use and disclose all such information so submitted to such third parties in the
                same manner in which We are entitled to use and disclose any other information You submit to Us. </p>

            <p> Any third party with whom We are allowed to share Your personal information is authorized to use Your
                personal information in accordance with Our contractual arrangements with such third parties and in
                accordance with their own privacy policies, over which We have no control, and You agree that We are not
                responsible or liable for any of their actions or omissions. Those who contact You will need to be
                instructed directly by You regarding Your preferences for the use of Your personal information by
                them. </p>

        <section>
            <h2>How We Use Demographic Data</h2>

            <p> We may review all demographic Data. We may use public information to enable other users to search Your
                profile, to determine whether Your trip details fit other user&apos;s requirements, and to communicate with
                You. We may use demographic information to tailor the Lyft Platform and communications to Your
                interests. We may also share demographic information with advertisers on an anonymous and aggregated
                basis (i.e., without telling the advertisers Your identity). One of the reasons We may do this is to
                increase the likelihood that Our advertisers&apos; goods and services will appeal to You as a user of the
                Lyft Platform. Our sharing of demographic information with advertisers is anonymous (i.e., We do not
                tell advertisers which particular Lyft Users are members of which demographic groups), subject to the
                rest of this privacy policy. When You respond to an advertisement, however, We ask You to remember that
                if that ad that is targeted to a demographic group and You decide to give the advertiser Your personal
                information, then the advertiser may be able to identify You as being a member of that demographic
                group. </p>

                information. </p>

            <p>So that We can protect the integrity of sensitive data, there are certain pieces of information, such as
                Your age, that You cannot alter Yourself. </p>

            <p>Our databases automatically update any personal information You edit in Your profile, or that You request
                We edit. Information transmitted through boards, chats, polls or through any other means remain in Our
                databases and become the property of Lyft upon submission. Keep this in mind if You decide to
                communicate personal information through any of these applications. </p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Information Retention</h2>

            <p> To preserve the integrity of Our databases, standard procedure calls for Us to retain information
                submitted by members for an indefinite length of time. Lyft understands Your submissions as consent to
                store all Your information in one place for this indefinite length of time, if We so wish. If required
                by law, as is the case to comply with the Children&apos;s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), We will
                nullify member information by erasing it from Our database. We will also respond to written member
                requests to nullify account information. Also, by using the Lyft Platform, You do hereby represent and
                warrant that You understand and agree that all information submitted by You through the Lyft Platform or
                otherwise to Lyft becomes the property of Lyft and may be used in the sole discretion of Lyft in
                accordance with this Privacy Policy and the Terms of Use. </p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Choice/Opt-Out</h2>

            <p> Lyft provides Users the opportunity to opt-out of receiving communications from Us and Our partners at
                the point where We request information about the visitor. Lyft gives Users the option to remove their
                information from Our database, to not receive future communications or to no longer receive Our
                service. </p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Special Cases in Which We Share Personal Information</h2>

            <p> Your personal information may be passed on to a third party in the event of a transfer of ownership or
                assets, or a bankruptcy. We may also disclose personal information when We determine that such
                disclosure is necessary to comply with applicable law, to cooperate with law enforcement or to protect
                the interests or safety of Lyft or other visitors to the Lyft Platform. We also may disclose Your
                personal information to Our subsidiary and parent companies and businesses, and other affiliated legal
                entities and businesses with whom We are under common corporate control. Whenever personal information
                is disclosed under this paragraph, We may also disclose Your demographic information along with it, on a
                non-anonymous basis. All of Our parent, subsidiary and affiliated legal entities and businesses that
                receive Your personal information or non-anonymous demographic information from Us will comply with the
                terms of this privacy policy with respect to their use and disclosure of such information. </p>

            <h2>Our Security Precautions</h2>

            <p> Your Lyft Profile is password-protected so that only You and authorized Lyft employees have access to
                Your account information. If You have registered for Lyft using Facebook Connect, then Your login and
                password shall be the same as Your Facebook login and password. In order to maintain this protection, do
                not give Your password to anyone. Lyft staff will never proactively reach out to You and ask for any
                personal account information, including Your password. If You share a computer, You should sign out of
                Your Lyft account and close the browser window before someone else logs on. This will help protect Your
                information entered on public terminals from disclosure to third parties. </p>

            <p>Lyft makes every effort to ensure that Your information is secure on its system. Lyft has staff dedicated
                to maintaining Our privacy policy as set forth herein and other privacy initiatives, periodically
                reviewing Web security and making sure that every Lyft employee is aware of Our security practices.
                Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result,
                Lyft cannot guarantee the security of any information You transmit to Us, and You do so at Your own
                risk. If You have any further questions on this issue, refer to Lyft Terms of Use. Lyft expressly
                disclaims any liability that may arise should any other individuals obtain the information You submit to
                the Lyft Platform. </p>

            <p> Lyft has security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of the
                information under Our control. Your information may be transferred to and maintained on computer
                networks which may be located outside of the state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction
                in which You reside, and the country or jurisdiction in which these computer networks are located may
                not have privacy laws as protective as the laws in Your country or jurisdiction. </p>

            <p> The Lyft Platform may contain links to other web sites. We are of course not responsible for the privacy
                practices of other web sites. We encourage Our Users to be aware when they leave the Lyft Platform to
                read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable
                information. This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected by the Lyft Platform. </p>

            <h2>Changing our Privacy Policy for Previously Gathered Information</h2>

            <p> If at any point We decide to use particular personally identifiable information in a manner materially
                different from that stated at the time it was collected, We will notify Users by way of an email or by
                providing 30 days notice on the Lyft Platform. We also encourage You to review this privacy policy
                periodically. By using the Lyft Platform, You do hereby represent and warrant that You have read,
                understand and agree to all terms of Agreement. Each time You use the Lyft Platform, You agree to all
                terms set forth in this Agreement and any other policies published by Lyft on the Lyft Platform. Please
                note that We will continue to have the right to change Our privacy policy and practices, and how We use
                Your personally identifiable information, without notice, as described in herein, provided that such
                changes shall only apply to information gathered on or after the date of the change. </p>
