We may provide these partners with information about the reach and effectiveness of their advertising without providing information that personally identifies you, or if we have aggregated the information so that it does not personally identify you. For example, we may tell an advertiser how its ads performed, or how many people viewed their ads or installed an app after seeing an ad, or provide non-personally identifying demographic information (such as 25 year old female, in Madrid, who likes software engineering) to these partners to help them understand their audience or customers, but only after the advertiser has agreed to abide by our <a href="/ad_guidelines.php">advertiser guidelines</a>. </div><div class="mvm uiP fsm">Please review your <a href="/help/769828729705201/">advertising preferences</a> to understand why you&#x2019;re seeing a particular ad on Facebook.

How do we respond to legal requests or prevent harm? </b></div><div class="mvm uiP fsm">We may access, preserve and share your information in response to a legal request (like a search warrant, court order or subpoena) if we have a good faith belief that the law requires us to do so.
