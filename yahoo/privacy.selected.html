The way we handle your information hasn&#x2019;t changed, so Yahoo&#x2019;s Privacy Policy still governs when you are on a Yahoo site, using a Yahoo app or interacting with our products, services or technologies. We may share non-personal information with our family companies for purposes such as product improvements, research and analysis, and to help them provide you with more relevant experiences. We will notify you about significant changes in the way we treat your information by sending a notice to the primary email address specified in your Yahoo account or by placing a prominent notice on our site.</i></p>

<p>Welcome to the Yahoo Privacy Center -- take a look around. You&apos;ll learn how Yahoo treats your personal information, along with ways to control your preferences and settings. As always, Yahoo is committed to gaining your trust.</p>
<h2><b>What This Privacy Policy Covers</b></h2>
<p><b>Yahoo takes your privacy seriously. Please read the following to learn more about our privacy policy.</b></p>
<p>The federal government and technology industry have developed <a href="http://onguardonline.gov/" class="bb-url">practical tips</a> to help you guard against Internet fraud, secure your computer and protect your personal information.</p>
<p><b>How Yahoo Uses Your Personal Information</b></p>
<p>This policy covers how Yahoo treats personal information that Yahoo collects and receives, including information related to your past use of Yahoo products and services. Personal information is information about you that is personally identifiable like your name, address, email address, or phone number, and that is not otherwise publicly available.</p>
<p><b>This privacy policy only applies to Yahoo</b></p>
<p>This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Yahoo does not own or control, or to people that Yahoo does not employ or manage. In addition, some companies that Yahoo has acquired have their own, preexisting privacy policies which may be viewed on our <a href="../../../../us/en/yahoo/privacy/topics/affiliates/index.htm" class="bb-url">affiliates page</a>.</p>
<p><b>Data Transfer</b></p>
<p>Your personal information may be transferred to countries other than your own to process and store data in accordance with our Privacy Policy and to provide you with products and services.  Some of these countries may not have the same data protection safeguards as the country where you reside. Yahoo may process personal information related to individuals in the EU and may transfer that information from the EU through various compliance mechanisms, including data processing agreements based on the EU Standard Contractual Clauses. By using our products and services, you consent to us transferring your data to these countries. We are committed to ensuring your information is protected and apply safeguards in accordance with applicable law.</p>
