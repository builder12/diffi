These third-party service providers may, for example, provide you with Services, verify your identity, assist in processing transactions, send you advertisements for our products and Services, or provide customer support.&#xA0;</p> <p><strong>With other financial institutions: </strong>We may share Personal Data with other financial institutions that we have partnered with to jointly create and offer a product, such as with Synchrony Bank in connection with the PayPal Extras credit card.&#xA0;

This data will not personally identify you or provide information about your use of the Sites or Services.&#xA0; We do not share your Personal Data with third parties for their marketing purposes without your consent.<br> &#xA0;</p> <h3><a id="6" name="6"></a>VI.&#xA0; How Do We Work with Other Services and Platforms?&#xA0;</h3> <p>A significant benefit and innovation of PayPal&#x2019;s Services is that you can connect your Account with a third-party account or platform.&#xA0; For the purposes of this Privacy Statement, an &#x201C;account connection&#x201D; with such a third-party is a connection you authorize or enable between your Account and a non-PayPal account, payment instrument, or platform that you lawfully control or own.&#xA0; When you authorize such a connection, PayPal and the third-party will exchange your Personal Data and other information directly.&#xA0; Examples of account connections include:</p> <ul> <li>linking your Account to a social media account or social messaging service;</li> <li>connecting your Account to a third-party data aggregation or financial services company, if you provide such company with your Account log-in credentials; or</li> <li>using your Account to make payments to a merchant or allowing a merchant to charge your Account.</li> </ul> <p>If you choose to create an account connection, we may receive information from the third-party about you and your use of the third-party&#x2019;s service.&#xA0; For example, if you connect your Account to a social media account, we will receive Personal Data from the social media provider via the account connection.&#xA0; If you connect your Account to other financial accounts, directly or through a third-party service provider, we may have access to your account balance and transactional information, such as purchases and funds transfers.&#xA0; We will use all such information that we receive from a third-party via an account connection in a manner consistent with this Privacy Statement.&#xA0;</p> <p>Information that we share with a third-party based on an account connection will be used and disclosed in accordance with the third-party&#x2019;s privacy practices.&#xA0; Before authorizing an account connection, you should review the privacy notice of any third-party that will gain access to your Personal Data as part of the account connection.&#xA0; For example, Personal Data that PayPal shares with a third-party account or platform such as a social media account may in turn be shared with certain other parties, including the general public, depending on the account&#x2019;s or platform&#x2019;s privacy practices.&#xA0;</p> <h3><a id="7" name="7"></a>VII.&#xA0;&#xA0;How Do We Use Cookies and Tracking Technologies?</h3> <p>When you visit our Sites, use our Services, or visit a third-party website for which we provide online Services, we and our business partners and vendors may use cookies and other tracking technologies (collectively, &#x201C;Cookies&#x201D;) to recognize you as a User and to customize your online experiences, the Services you use, and other online content and advertising;
